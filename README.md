Real-time LoRa mesh packet analyzer. Desktop-first, dark-mode-primary, dense information display for radio hobbyists.

Built with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, TanStack Query, and TanStack Virtual.

[My Atlas](docs/my-atlas.md) provides saved node cards with compact reception activity
bars, received-signal meters, and expandable observer evidence. Selections persist
in the visitor's browser; English and French are supported.

## Experimental n30nex-test branch

This branch combines pinned route-evidence links and My Atlas for the Pi preview.
It is experimental; the 1.4.0 release policy below still excludes Atlas from the
stable release. No review or production promotion is requested for this branch.

## Deployment

### Beacon 1.4.0 release

Beacon 1.4.0 is the planned replacement for CoreScope at **https://live.meshcore.ca**.
**https://dev.meshcore.ca** remains a separate development deployment. Alderson
controls the production switch; changing this repository does not switch either host.
My Atlas remains a separate feature for after 1.4.0.

Follow the [1.4.0 release and cutover plan](https://github.com/MeshCore-Beacon/beacon-docs/blob/main/app_documentation/release-140-preparation.md)
for the matched server revision, retained data, validation and rollback.
Use the complete deployment in beacon-docs for the same-origin MeshCore Canada
sites; it routes `/api/*` and `/ws` to the backend. The `docker/` example below
serves only the frontend and requires a separately reachable backend.

### 1. Copy the `docker/` folder to your server

```bash
scp -r docker/ user@your-server:/opt/docker/beacon-web
```

### 2. Create a `.env` file

```bash
cd /opt/docker/beacon-web
cat > .env << 'EOF'
DOMAIN=web.example.com
BEACON_WEB_IMAGE=ghcr.io/meshcore-beacon/beacon-web:1.4.0
VITE_API_BASE=https://api.example.com/api/v1
VITE_WS_URL=wss://api.example.com/ws
EOF
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DOMAIN` | Domain for HTTPS (Caddy auto-provisions Let's Encrypt certs) |
| `BEACON_WEB_IMAGE` | Required reviewed release tag or immutable digest; `:dev` is for development only |
| `VITE_API_BASE` | Backend REST API base URL |
| `VITE_WS_URL` | Backend WebSocket URL |

### 3. Start the services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The images are public on GitHub Container Registry — no `docker login` required.
If a pull fails with `403 Forbidden`, the package visibility has regressed to
Private; a maintainer needs to set it back to Public (see the troubleshooting note
in [beacon-docs](https://github.com/MeshCore-Beacon/beacon-docs)).

Caddy will automatically obtain a TLS certificate for your domain. Ensure DNS is pointed at your server before starting.

The example requires the 1.4.0 release image to exist. Verify its Actions build and
pin its digest before the production cutover. For the complete development deployment, use
`DOMAIN=dev.meshcore.ca`, `BEACON_WEB_IMAGE=ghcr.io/meshcore-beacon/beacon-web:dev`
and matching development REST/WebSocket URLs in the beacon-docs topology. Use separate deployment directories.
Branch builds publish revision tags, and `dev` builds also publish `dev`; only
stable semantic-version tags publish `latest`. Main-branch and prerelease builds
do not move `latest`.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # edit with your backend URLs
npm run dev             # starts Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and build for production |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npx vitest run` | Run tests |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | Type-check without emitting |

```

## Architecture

- **Region-driven**: All data queries and WS subscriptions are scoped to an IATA region code. Changing region resets the cache and resubscribes.
- **Live + historical merge**: WebSocket pushes live packets into a `LivePacketStore` buffer (capped at 500). Historical data comes from cursor-paginated REST via `useInfiniteQuery` (max 20 pages). Both are merged and deduped at render time.
- **Client-side filtering**: Filters are not part of the query key. The cache holds all packets for the current region; filters are applied via `useMemo`. Toggling a filter is instant with no refetch.
- **Reconnect with jitter**: Exponential backoff with +/-25% random jitter prevents thundering herd on server bounce.
